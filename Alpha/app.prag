type app [incomplete]
{{
	Type app is an adaptable base type with an abstract
	entry-point method.

	Every application must have at least one type that 
	derives from app and implements abstract ~run.

	A particular app subtype is designated when the
	application is built.  The application startup routine
	creates an object of the designated type, then calls 
	~run.  

	~run should monitor given stop signal and return
	asap if it indicates.
